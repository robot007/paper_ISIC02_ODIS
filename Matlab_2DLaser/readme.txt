Hi,

Thanks for using 2D laser sensing package.
The CppCode directory contains NewMat and Circle Fit algorithms in C++. For more details, please 
read "Manual of ODIS Fitting Functions.pdf".
This is the free code for the paper:
``Some Sensing and Perception Techniques for an Omnidirectional Ground Vehicle''

You can just Run ``isicdemo'' under Matlab to see the demo.
You can cite this paper as
